I received my PhD in Public Policy from the Harvard Kennedy School in May 2024. I recently joined the London office of Cornerstone Research as an Associate.

My research focuses on environmental economics and  public finance, with a particular interest in environmental justice. I am a 2022 grantee of the [Washington Center for Equitable Growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/people/tridevi-chakma/) doctoral grant.

Prior to the PhD program, I worked at Oxera Consulting in London. I completed an MSc in finance and economics at the London School of Economics and a bachelors degree in finance at the Australian National University.
