I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and a pre-doctoral fellow at the [Harvard Environmental Economics Program](https://heep.hks.harvard.edu). My research focuses on environmental economics and  public finance, and applied microeconomics. I am a 2022 grantee of the [Washington Center for Equitable Growth](https://equitablegrowth.org/people/tridevi-chakma/) doctoral grant and an affiliate of the [Environmental Inequality Lab](https://www.environmental-inequality-lab.org).

Prior to the PhD program, I worked at Oxera Consulting in London. I completed an MSc in finance and economics at the London School of Economics and a bachelors degree in finance at the Australian National University.
