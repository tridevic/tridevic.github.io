I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and a pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Environmental Economics Program. My research focuses on environmental economics and  public finance, and applied microeconomics. I am a 2022 grantee of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth doctoral grant and an affiliate of the Environmental Inequality Lab.

Prior to the PhD program, I worked at Oxera Consulting in London. I completed an MSc in finance and economics at the London School of Economics and a bachelors degree in finance at the Australian National University.
