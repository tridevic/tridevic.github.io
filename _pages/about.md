I am a PhD candidate in Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and a pre-doctoral fellow at the Harvard Environmental Economics Program. My research focuses on environmental economics and  public finance, and applied microeconomics. I am a 2022 grantee of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth doctoral grant and an affiliate of the Environmental Inequality Lab.

Prior to the PhD program, I worked at Oxera Consulting in London. I completed an MSc in finance and economics at the London School of Economics and a bachelors degree in finance at the Australian National University.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
