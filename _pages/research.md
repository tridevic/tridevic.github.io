## Concrete Jungles: the Determinants of Imperviousness and Urban Heat

Within the same city, temperatures vary substantially over short distances as a function of land cover. Impervious surfaces---such as pavements, roads and buildings---absorb and retain heat, while tree canopy counteracts higher temperatures. These local variations in temperature matter for mortality; on hot days, local imperviousness correlates with mortality conditional on air temperature imputed from weather stations. Moreover, there are substantial racial disparities in neighborhood imperviousness and surface temperature within the same city. What are the causes of spatial variation in imperviousness that drive these local differences in temperature? This paper examines how zoning policies that regulate housing density drive variations in imperviousness. Using the Greater Boston area as a case study and based on a spatial discontinuity design along zoning district boundaries, I find that density regulations decreases tree cover, increases share of impervious surfaces and consequently, surface temperature, on the side of the boundary with higher regulated density. Using spatial data on single family and multi-family zoning for over a hundred cities, I find that areas zoned for multi-family homes experience a greater increase in density and imperviousness, and a larger decrease in greenness, in response to city-wide housing demand shocks. I find that zoning regulations have deep historical roots, as historically Black neighborhoods are more likely to be zoned for higher density land-uses today.

## The Origins of Racial Disparities in Heat Exposure: Evidence from the Great Migration
Relative to white households in the same U.S. city, Black households live in neighborhoods that are characterized by a higher degree of impervious surfaces and residential density, and are hotter in summer. What explains the large and persistent racial disparities in heat exposure? Using racial composition shocks during the Great Migration as a natural experiment, I find that a one standard deviation larger increase in the historical Black population explains 20â€“40% of the present-day Black- white gaps in imperviousness, residential density, and summer surface temperature. I develop a residential sorting model to illustrate how early constraints on Black households' neighborhood choices result in development of greater density and concentrated imperviousness in Black neighborhoods.


## Where Does Air Quality Matter? New Evidence from the Housing Market
*[joint with Eleanor Krause]*

Economists often exploit changes in local housing prices to estimate the demand for local environmental improvements. However, when housing is elastically supplied, amenity improvements may yield an expansion of the housing market, muting the capitalization of the amenity into housing prices. We demonstrate how the elasticity of the local housing market critically affects empirical valuations of amenity changes by influencing the price and quantity of housing. Leveraging local air quality improvements induced by the Clean Air Act and heterogeneity in housing supply constraints, we present consistent evidence that air quality improvements yield substantially larger housing price responses in places with less elastic housing supply. We present a model of spatial equilibrium that provides expressions for local prices, populations, and wages as functions of local amenities, and use this model to estimate marginal willingness to pay for PM2.5 reductions across U.S. counties.
